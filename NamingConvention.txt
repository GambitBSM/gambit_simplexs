This is a little read me file to explain my naming convention for the data files.

1. All the files are written as:

    comenergy_LowerPIDcode_higherPIDcode_extrainfo.txt

2. Most of PID codes are:

    gluino-------------------1000021
    neutralino 1-------------1000022
    neutralino 2-------------1000023
    stop---------------------1000005 
    sbottom------------------1000006 
    slepton -----------------1000011

Exceptions:

degeneratehino: The files labelled hino are for higgsino, with full degeneracy between N1, C1, N2. Therefore if the PID pair is ones of these two and this data file is listed as an input, then there will be a degeneracy factor of 3.

squark_antisquark: Degenerate squarks with a degeneracy of 10

squark_gluino: Degenerate squarks with a degeneracy of 8

chargino: Some tables references either positive or negative, and so I have denoted the combination of two of these as p,m,pm (stands for plus, minus, plus minus)
